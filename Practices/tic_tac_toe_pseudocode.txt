AP 1st Period, Tic Tac Toe Pseudocode

import random

make the board with each spot saved as a variable with each variable being assigned a number 1-9 as a placeholder

start a loop that will loop the whole game unitl someone wins 
    print the board and ask the user which spot they want to put their X in

    replace the varaible corresponding to that with an X

    have the computer randomly choose a spot

    check if the spot has been taken

    if it has been taken, then choose another one

    if it hasn't been taken then replace the value with O

    display the updated board with the users and computers chosen spots

    check each possible win condition, checking if any complete rows, columns, or diagonals have been filled by one symbol

    check if every spot has been filled AND no one has won

    if no one has won and every spot is filled, then print that it was a tie and break out of the loop

    if neither has won, then continue to the next iteration of the loop

    if someone has won, print who has won and break the loop
